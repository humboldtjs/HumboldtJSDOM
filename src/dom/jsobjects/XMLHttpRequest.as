		 * Your XML document is well formed. responseXML will always return null if not.
		 * In Firefox, call request.overrideMimeType('text/xml') at the start of your Ajax request (upon instantiation) to explicitly tell the browser that the returned data will have a content type of "text/xml".
		 * IE doesn't support the client side overrideMimeType() method, so you must ensure that your server returns the proper "text/xml" content header type for the XML file that is being returned. If your XML file is named with an extension of ".xml", most servers by default send out the proper "text/xml" headers, though if it is not, you'll want to modify your server settings to do so. See "XML documents and the Content-type pitfall in IE" for more info.

		 * url: The relative or full URL to the Ajax request. All modern browsers restrict this url to the same domain as the page making the request. For cross domain Ajax requests, a "web proxy" needs to be used to first bring the data from the remote host onto the current, such as via PHP's file_get_contents() method or Curl before opening a request to the local copy of the data.
		 * async: Optional Boolean parameter that specifies whether the request should be asynchronous (default) or synchronous (true=async, false=sync). In the later, the request stalls the loading of the rest of the page until the request is completed.
		 * username: Optional parameter for specifying the username of an authenticated request.
		 * password: Optional parameter for specifying the password of an authenticated request.

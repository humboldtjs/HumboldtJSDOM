HumboldtJSDOM
=============

## What is it?

HumboldtJSDOM is a library that can be used in conjunction with Humboldtjs to
provide code completion and compile-time syntax checking on the HTML DOM.

## What do I do with it?

Usually you will only want the *bin/HumboldtJSDOM.swc* and *dom* folder and
drop that into your project. You can safely ignore the rest of this repository.
The rest is only needed if you want to change the default DOM bindings or
improve on them.

## How to build it?

After cloning this repository you can import the folder as an existing project
in Adobe Flash Builder. This may not be needed depending on your usage
scenario. Actually building the library is done by running the ant build
script in the *build* folder.
